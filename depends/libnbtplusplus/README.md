# libnbt++ 2 (WIP)

libnbt++ is a free C++ library for Minecraft's file format Named Binary Tag
(NBT). It can read and write compressed and uncompressed NBT files and
provides a code interface for working with NBT data.

----------

libnbt++2 is a remake of the old libnbt++ library with the goal of making it
more easily usable and fixing some problems. The old libnbt++ especially
suffered from a very convoluted syntax and boilerplate code needed to work
with NBT data.
